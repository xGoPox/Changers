If you decide to register via another SNS-account, we will obtain the personal data that you have provided to the applicable SNS (such as your “real“ name, e-Mail address, profile picture, names of SNS friends, names of SNS groups to which you belong, etc.).

Collection of local position- and movement-data through the Changers App</p>
5.1.	The Changers App for mobile devices that is provided free of charge by the Provider to all Users allows Users in addition to the usual functions and services of the Website, to collect data on their use of more or less CO2-saving means of transport for certain travel routes, to evaluate and transfer them to their User Profile at the Changers Community.</p>
5.2.	To achieve this, the Changers App makes use of the GPS- and tracking-network-interfaces of the respective mobile devices to locate the User's current position, to measure the covered distance and, for the purpose of verifying the User's information on the used means of transport, to compare this with maps and other publicly available data.</p>
5.3.	The collected data will be processed in such a manner that only the data on the distance travelled and the means of transport that was used are eventually saved with the User's profile; any data on the User's position and movements collected in the process are utterly deleted after this processing. The Operator notifies the User, however, that it can not warrant or guarantee this process to be entirely secure this data against any illegal access to this data by means of abuse of the network-interfaces used also by the Changers App.</p>
5.4.	The Changers App as well as the respective functions of the Website where the Users display and share their mobility indices, allow for the Users to delete this data partly or entirely at any time. The Operator wants to ensure the User's complete control over their personal data. This provision applies without prejudice to the User's legal claim for information (see Art. VII of this PP). The deletion of the Users personal mobility-data does not include the aggregated and anonymized data the Operator gathers to create statistics of collective energy-saving-efforts of the Changers Community.</p>
