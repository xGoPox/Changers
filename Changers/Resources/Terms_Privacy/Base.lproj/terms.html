        (hereafter referred to as „the Operator“)</p>
        by all internet-users who are registered on the website (hereafter referred to as “Users” / ”the User”).</p>
        
        I. Introduction</p>
        
        <p>1. The Operator owns and operates a social community website under their brand name “Changers Community”, freely accessible via the web-addresses 'www.changers.com' and 'www.changers.de' (hereafter referred to as “the Website”). On this website, users can register in accordance with these Community ToU, set up a user account as a community-member (hereafter referred to as “user account”) and have full access to the Operator's services that are described in detail below.</p>
        <p>2. Within the the Changers Community, the Users can collect data values about their changes and achievements with regard to energy use and environmentally conscious behavior. These achievements can be displayed in different indices and scores which can be compared and discussed among the Changers Community members. By thus playfully participating in the collective efforts of the Community, the Users can provide a significant contribution to easing the burden on the environment and at the same time obtain access to attractive products and services of our Partners and licensed Retailers at reduced prices.</p>
        3. For this, the Users' achievements are converted into the Community's “Changers ReCoins”. ReCoins are a digital currency, based on renewable energy and CO2 Savings. The Changers ReCoins are produced with selected Partners in developing countries where solar energy is of immediate use to the rural population. Also, the users are able to mine their own ReCoins by recording the their own energy production, using CO2-neutral devices with our in-house solar power meter, and convert their contribution into Changers ReCoins.</p>
        4. Each ReCoin is based on one Watt-hour of regenerative energy. Hence, ReCoins are a digital currency with intrinsic value. The mining of our ReCoins after this procedure has been protected by the Operator under patent  US Patent 8463561.</p>
        5. With their participation in the Changers Community, the Users can can collect ReCoins, they can obtain them as bonus awards for a purchase at our licensed Retailers or redeem them for price-reductions when purchasing from such Retailers. The Users acknowledge that ReCoins can not be directly converted into any money currency and that there is especially no claim on whatever ground against the Operator for any such exchange.</p>
